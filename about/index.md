My name is Devendra Rath. I make products because I enjoy making things and providing value to others. I make some products with large corporations, some with my three year old, some with my friends, but I always make it _with someone_. 

Do you have an idea to make something? [Drop me a note](mailto:devendra_rath@yahoo.com).
